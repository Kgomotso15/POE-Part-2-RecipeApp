Changes made from Part 1: (Total words: 195)
Change 1: For the Quantity question display, I've enhanced the error handling mechanism to offer a smoother user experience. Now, if a user provides incorrect input, such as responding with "one" when asked for the quantity of ingredient 1, the program won't simply halt and restart. Instead, it intelligently rephrases the question or provides prompts to guide the user towards the correct input. This iterative approach ensures that users can swiftly rectify their mistakes without feeling frustrated or overwhelmed. By offering multiple attempts to input the correct information, the program fosters a more user-friendly and engaging interaction.
Change 2: Similarly, I've refined the error handling process for the Steps display question to enhance usability. If a user provides an incorrect input, such as stating "one" when asked for the number of steps, the program no longer abruptly terminates. Instead, it gracefully guides the user through the correction process by rephrasing the question or offering helpful prompts. By prioritizing user feedback and iterative improvement, the program delivers a more intuitive and enjoyable experience for users of all skill levels.
Change 3: In response to feedback, I've revamped the recipe display to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
